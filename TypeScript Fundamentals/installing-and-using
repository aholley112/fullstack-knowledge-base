Typescript does not run in the browser so we have to compile it to JS. If you try to execute it in the browser, it will fail.

To run the compiler via tsc use: npx tsc. Or use a slightly modified version where you point to a file that should be compiled. Use npx tsc with-typescript.ts(this is the name of my file).

During the compilation step we will be notified of code problems and errors. It's then the compiled code that will run in the browser.

You protect yourself against more errors with using typescript.
