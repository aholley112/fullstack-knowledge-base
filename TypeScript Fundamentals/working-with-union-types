# Union Types

Up to this point we assumed every variable took just one type. But sometimes you want to allow different types.

Some variables allow two different types of objects. A union type is a definition that allows more than one type. You add it by adding a colon after the variable name to the left of the = sign and then your type.

# How to code it

Add a pipe symbol after the first type such as string and then after the other type such as number.
