# What is typescript?

typeScript is a superset to JavaScript. It's a programming language that builds up on JavaScript. JS is still the core programming language. TypeScrpt adds more features to the JS syntax. 

# Important reasons for typescript

It adds static typing to JS. JS on its own is dynamically typed. 
The function in JS doesn't expect any particular types. It knows it will receive parameters.

If there's a lot of people working on code it makes more sense to use typescript because people may call the same function. Typescript helps.
