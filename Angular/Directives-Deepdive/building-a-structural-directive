# Building a structural directive

This guide is about structural directives and provides conceptual information on how such directives work, how Angular interprets their shorthand syntax, and how to add template guard properties to catch template type errors.

Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.

Angular provides a set of built-in structural directives (such as NgIf, NgForOf, NgSwitch and others) which are commonly used in all Angular projects. For more information see Built-in directives.

When structural directives are applied they generally are prefixed by an asterisk, *, such as *ngIf. This convention is shorthand that Angular interprets and converts into a longer form. Angular transforms the asterisk in front of a structural directive into an <ng-template> that surrounds the host element and its descendants.
