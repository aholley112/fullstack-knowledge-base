# Creating a basic attribute directive

We want to pick a unique selector. But we want to it to be clear.

Wrap it in brackets for style so you don't have to wrap it in brackets in other places of the code.

We can inject the element the directive sits on into this directive.

We will learn about injection more later.

# Important

We're getting access to the element the directive was placed on, getting access to that exact element and then overwriting the style.

To use it we have to inform Angular that we have a new directive. Go to app module. In declerations, add your directive and then add the import pointing to the folder and file you need.
