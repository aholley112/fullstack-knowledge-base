# ngFor and ngIf Recap

The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}. If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.

The ngFor directive is a structural directive that renders a template for each item in a collection. The directive is placed on an element, which becomes the parent of the cloned templates.
