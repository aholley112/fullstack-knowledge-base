# Understanding async Pipe

We have to have a promise and we will initialize the promise with a callback method passed to the constructor. 

In Angular, the async pipe is a pipe that essentially does these three tasks: It subscribes to an observable or a promise and returns the last emitted value. Whenever a new value is emitted, it marks the component to be checked. That means Angular will run Change Detector for that component in the next cycle.
