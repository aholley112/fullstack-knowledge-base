# Parametrizing Pipes

A pipe is only responsible for transforming the output so the place to use it is in the template.

We added the Uppercase pipe to transform the instance and the date pipe to transform the type.

We want to configure it though because the layout isn't that great. So we are going to parametrize it.

We add a colon and pass a paramter to it. 

{{ server.started  date: 'fullDate' }}
