# Pure and impure pipes

If we allow the user to add a new server it gets added here but you don't see it if we hit the button.

This is not actually a bug. 

# Reason for behavior

Angular is not rerunning our pipe on the data whenever this data changes. As soon as we change what we enter and even if we only add a blank space, it will be updated. It triggers a recalculation.
