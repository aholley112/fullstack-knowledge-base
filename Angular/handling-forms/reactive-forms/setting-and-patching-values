# Setting and patching values

You can of course on your form as a whole call setValue and pass a JS object which should now resemble the object structure up here when you create the form.

We can set and patch values the same way we did in the template driven approach.

setValue requires a form of the same format as initialized and patchValue can only set specific parts.
