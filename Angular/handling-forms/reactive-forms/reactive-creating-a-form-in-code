# Creating a form in code

Use ngOnInit and import it from @angular/core.

In the ngOnInit is where we will initialize the form.

You should initialize it before rendering the template of course, so make sure to use a lifecycle hook which is called before the template is rendered.

this.signupForm = new FormGroup()
FormGroup() takes in an object or objects with controls.

Controls are just key value pairs that we pass.
