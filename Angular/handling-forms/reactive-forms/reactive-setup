# Reactive setup

It's set up programattically in typescript code so we should start working in our typescript file. We need to create a new property that will hold our program in the end.

Important: It needs to be the type 'Form Group' and it needs to be imported from '@angular/forms',

You do not need the FormsModule but you do need to import the ReactiveFormsModule.

FormsModule is required in the template driven approach.
