# Reactive adding validation

You're not configuring the form in the HTML template, you're only synchronizing it with the directives, form Control Name and formGroup but you're not configuring it here.

The second argument on FormControl is for validators.
You must import Validators from angular/forms.
'username': new FormControl(null, Validators.required).

You can also pass an array of multiple validators.
'email': new FormControl(null, [Validators.required, Validators.email]),
