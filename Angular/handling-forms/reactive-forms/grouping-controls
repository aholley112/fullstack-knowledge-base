# Grouping controls

Get takes the path to an element. 

You can specificy a path because you might have a nested form. Such as username and email which should be inside of form group.

Here we could create a form group called user data. FormGroup is not only there to be used on the overall form but you can have formgroup within a formgroup.

We must reflect the nested form in our HTML template.
