# Creating a custom async validator

Typically you might need to reach out to a web server to check this. That however is asynchronous operation because the response isn't coming back instantly. It takes a few seconds.

This is why we need asyncronous validators. They are able to wait for a response or before returning true or false. 

We can create these in the app component.

Example here will be forbiddenEmails. It takes control as an argument and we need to return something. Promise or Observable.

Promise must be imported.
