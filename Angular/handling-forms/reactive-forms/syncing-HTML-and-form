# Syncing HTML and form

We need to syncronize the HTML inputs with our form. Right now angular doesn't know which of our typescript controls relates to which input.

Right now it is autodetecting that there is a form and creating a form for us. But we don't want this.

Must add directives to override this behavior. 

Must import reactiveFormsModule.

We must add <form [formGroup]="signupForm">

Use the formControlName directive on your input to tell angular which control it is in your typescript form
