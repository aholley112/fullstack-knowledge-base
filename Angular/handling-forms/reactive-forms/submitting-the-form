# Submitting the form

We used ngSubmit in the template driven approach.

We will add this method, onSubmit, but the difference from the template driven approach is that we don't need to get the form via this local reference, that actually wouldn't work.

We don't need to get this reference because we created the form on our own. So we can simply console log this.signupForm and this how we get access.
