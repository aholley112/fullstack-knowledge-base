# Adding validation to check User Input

validation is always so important.

Adding "required" will make it to where they can't leave an empty field. Required is only treated as a selector for an angular directive.

Angular tracks the form and the state of the validity.

 It dynamically adds some classess giving us information about the individual controls.
