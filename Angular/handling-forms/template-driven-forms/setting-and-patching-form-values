# Setting and patching form values

In this example we want to populate this username input here with this username.

We can use the setValue and here we need to pass a Javascript object exactly representing our form.

Accessing the form with @ViewChild, you can call .setValue() to pass an object the same type as the form
This will override all user inputs, though
formName.form.patchValue() will set the value for only data specified.

# Example

this.formName.form.patchValue({ userData: { username: suggestedName }});
