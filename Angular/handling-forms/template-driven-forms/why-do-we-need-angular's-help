# Why do we need angulars help?

On the angular side of your app it will check validity. But we need to be able to parse the values and we need some JS object representation in our form.

{
    value: {
        name: 'Max',
        email: 'test@test.com'
    }
    valid: true
}

Angular gives you a JS object representation making it simple for you to see the values.
