# Accessing the form with @ViewChild

Right now we submit the form by passing the form which we get via ngForm here to the onSubmit method, which is probably what we will do most often.

You don't have to submit it here though. You can also use @ViewChild.

Alternative: 

export class AppComponent {
    @ViewChild

    suggestUserName() {
        const suggestedName = 'Superuser';
    }
}

#Important

ViewChild must be imported.
