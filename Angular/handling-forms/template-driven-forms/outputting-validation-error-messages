# Outputting validation error messages

Now we can use a bootstrap class here, help-block, to make sure that this has the appropriate styling. Then we could say please enter a valid email.

Of course we only want to show this if the input is actually invalid.

by adding a local reference to the input element and then associating it with ngModel.
