# Adding the shopping list form

We want to use the template driven approach here. 

We need to get rid of the local references and the click listener on the add button.

We now want to use ngSubmit to submit the form and then call on Add Item.

We also want to get access to the form created by Angular and we can get access by placing a local reference on the form element.
