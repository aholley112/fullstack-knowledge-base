# Caching dynamic assets and urls

We can also prefetch the API.

We add a new configuration item called dataGroups.

We have assetGroups here but we can have dataGroups for dynamic data. Data you request from an API or that might change frequently.

One dataGroup is an object. Define a name of your choice. Here we choose: "post". Then we define the URLs we want to handle. In this case it's the URL in our app component.
