# Caching assets for offline use

First we have the index page which is the root page. 

Then we have two asset groups, these objects.

Asset groups are configurations that define which static assets should be cached.

Dynamic assets, for example, would be the data from the API. So it's not static. It changes frequently.

Our HTML file, our JS code will also change.
