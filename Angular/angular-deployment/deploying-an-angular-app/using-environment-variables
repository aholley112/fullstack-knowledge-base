# Using environment variables

First we have to dive into the enviornment variable.

It's built into every project in the source folder, app folder, environments

You can store the API key in the environments page.

During production, the constant will be true. And in the other one, it will be false. 

Some API keys are meant to use during development and some may only be for production.

Once you add your keys to your enviornment page you need to go back and import them in the auth service file.
