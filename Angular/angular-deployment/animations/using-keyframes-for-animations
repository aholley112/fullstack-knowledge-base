# Using keyframes for animations

We want to go over two more things.

A more detailed control over the individual steps in the animation process.

We want to define some keyframes to say you animate over one second. After 200 you should have this state and then after 500, this state.

Copy our trigger a final time and set up list two.

[@List2]

Keyframes are for the time DURING the transition. 

This is what we used: trigger('list2', [
      state('in', style({
        opacity: 1,
        transform: 'translateX(0)'
      })),
      transition('void => *', [
        animate(1000, keyframes([
          style({
            transform: 'translateX(-100px)',
            opacity: 0,
            offset: 0
          }),
          style({
            transform: 'translateX(-50px)',
            opacity: 0.5,
            offset: 0.3
          }),
