# Animations triggers and state

Also use the resource: https://angular.io/guide/transition-and-triggers

We're going to the app component.

We add animations: [] into the @Component.

We will use the same name as we do in normal CSS styles.

Each animation has a trigger and that has to be imported. 

With a trigger, which is a function, we tell Angular we want to define a certain name. 

You transition from state one to state two when we're working with them. 

We won't see the change until we change our div in the HTML
