# Grouping transitions

We can add a new animate function if we want a second style.

We have to be careful and make sure that the order is correct.

If we don't want one animation to finish before starting the next we can use this by passing or by using the group method.

We have to import this from angular core.

We pass an array of animations we want to perform syncronously or at the same time.
