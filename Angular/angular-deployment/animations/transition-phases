# Transition phases

Now we only have starting and ending state.

But we can not only paste the timing we can control the whole animation and define styles the animations should take during animation.

Pass a second argument.

We can also define the style during the state and animation. So we pass a JS object. 

We're going to replace the animate function with an array.

You have to end with animate(500) or something like that to make sure it doesn't snap back at the end.
