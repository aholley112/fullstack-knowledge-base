# Using animation callback

There are some callbacks you can listen to so when the animation finishes you can execute some other code.

In the app component on the div element we can listen to callbacks.

(@divState.start)="animationStarted($event)'
(@divState.done)="animationEnded($event)

Then make sure it's in our ts component.
