# Data binding and event binding

In our alert component we do have @input and @output but we're not using property or event binding on our component at the moment becuase we created it here in code.

How can we pass data into the component or listen to an event now?

We have to store the component inside of a constant or variable where we can work.

const componentRef.

Now we can interact with it.
