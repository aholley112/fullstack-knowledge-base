# Using ngIf

At the moment, because of ngIf, our alert component is included in our auth.component.html with its selector and controlled with ngIF.

The advantage is that we don't have to manually create it and we can also pass data in as we learn it here with property binding.

Listening to events is simple as well.

Emitting an event in alert.ts is what we do to use output.
