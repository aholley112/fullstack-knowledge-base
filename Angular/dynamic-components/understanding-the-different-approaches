# Understanding the different approaches.

Dynamic components just mean you want to display some component dynamically. It's not always there but it's there once something specific happens in your code.

You want to control programmatically when it should be displayed.

# *ngIF

*ngIF allows you to use a declarative approach and then it only loads upon a certain condition.

Component embedded via selector(declaratively)
controls whether component is added to the DOM

# Alternative (dynamic component loader)

This doesn't exist anymore and you shouldn't use it anymore.
