# Injecting the Logging Service into Components

Dependcy injector gives us access.

A dependency is something a class of ours will depend on. 

For example: the new account component depends on the loggingService because we want to call a method in that servivce and the dependcy injector injects this dependency, or an instance of this class into the component automatically.

We just need to inform Angular that we require such instance.

We add a constructor where we want to use the service.
