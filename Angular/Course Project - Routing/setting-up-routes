# Setting up routes

Root routes have the routes for our overall application.

The way we've configured it, we will alwawys redirect the router because the default matching strategy of the router is for the path, it will see if it's a prefix of the current path.

The empty path is therefore, part of any route we visit. It will check if the empty path is part of the total path.

An empty path is part of every route. Have to add the pathMatch.
