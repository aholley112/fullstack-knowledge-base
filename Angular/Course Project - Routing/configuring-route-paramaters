# Configuring route paramaters

As of now our loading recipe detail component doesn't work anymore. The reason for this is that here, we use recipe all over the place and that's a property of this component but it's set through property binding with @Input so it aways to be set from outside the component.

It won't work anymore because of routing so we have to change recipe.

We pass a dynamic paramater ID and will be able to load the recipe.
