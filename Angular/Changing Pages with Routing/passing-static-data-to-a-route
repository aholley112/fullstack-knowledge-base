# Passing static data to a route

 Some routes depend on data they receive, either statically each time they are loaded or they will resolve dynamically.

 # Static data

 We want to create a new error page component which will be generic.

 errorMessage we want to output by string interpolation. We must add errorMessage to our component

 export class ErrorPageComponent implements Oninit {
 errorMessage: string;

 constructor (private route: ActivatedRoute) { }
 
 ngOnInit() {
    this.errorMessage = this.route.snapshot.data ['message']
 }
 }
