# Outsourcing the route configuration

Typically if you have more than 2 or 3 routes you don't add it directly in the app module.

You add a new file which is for hte application as a whole, called AppRoutingModule.

The app-routing.module.ts file usually goes after app.module.ts.

import { ngModule } from '@angular/core';

const....

@NgModule({ })


export class AppRoutingModule {}
