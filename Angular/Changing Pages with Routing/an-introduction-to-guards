# An introduction to guards

Route guards.

So basically functionality, locic code which is executed before a route is loaded or once you want to leave a route.

A simple use case. let's say you only want to give access to your server component or the added server component if the user is logged in.

We want to check this before any of our subroutes here are accessed. Manually checking this in the onInint function would be very cumbersome.

We want to use a feature built into the angular router.
