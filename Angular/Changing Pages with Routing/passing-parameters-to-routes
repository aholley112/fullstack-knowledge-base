# Passing paramaters to routes

Pass params to a route by putting them in an object as a second parameter to the navigation.navigate function: navigation.navigate('RouteName', { /* params go here */ })
Read the params in your screen component: route.params .

# Example

'users/:id'

A colon tells Angular this is dynamic or an angular part of the path.
