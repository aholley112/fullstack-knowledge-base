# Protecting routes with canActive

We want to protect some of our routes and we can use a feature offered by angular that allows us to run code at a point of time defined by us.

Add a new file in our root folder named auth-guard.service.ts

Then we will export class named AuthGuard or AuthGuardService followed by 'implements CanActivate {}'

# Example

import {
    CanActivate,
    ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    RouterStateSnapshot
} from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from angular/core;
import { Injectable } from angular/core;

export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
    canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean ){
    }
