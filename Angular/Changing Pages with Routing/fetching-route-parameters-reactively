# Fetching route paramaters reactively

There are ways to break this. There are places this approach will not work.

# Example

Angular looks and finds the fitting route, loads the component, intializes the component and gives us the data by accessing the snapshot.

This only happens if we haven't been on this component before. Angular doesn't reinstantiate a component. Why would it rerender a component we are already on.

ngOnInit() {
    this.user = {
        id: this.route.snapshot.params['id'],
        name: this.route.snapshot.params['name']
    };
    this.route.params
        .subscribe(
            (params:Params) => {
                this.user.id = params ['id'],
                this.user.name = params ['name'];
            }
