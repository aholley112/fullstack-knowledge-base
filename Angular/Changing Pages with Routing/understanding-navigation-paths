# Understanding navigation paths

With a relative path, it always appends the path you specify in the routerLink to the end of your current path.

# Important

The current path depends on what component you are currently on.

This is how you can navigate around.

Absolute paths with a slash at the beginning which will always get appended at the root domain.

Relative paths without a slash or with ./ which means added to the currently loaded path or ../ and you can even add more of them to go back one path, go back another path.
