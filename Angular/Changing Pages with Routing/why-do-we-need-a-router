# Why do we need a router

We want to communicate between components.

Listen to a click when we create a new page and on that page we submit some data to the new component.

Angular ships with its own router which allows you to change the URL in the URL bar and still only use one page but exchange one parts or a lot of parts of that page. 

This allows the user to see multiple pages but behind the screen it's just JS changing parts in your single page application.
