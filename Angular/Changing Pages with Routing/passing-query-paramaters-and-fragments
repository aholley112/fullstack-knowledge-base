# Passing query paramaters and fragments.

These are paramaters seperated by a question mark.

Like mode = editing.
'#' to jump somewhere.


How can you pass them using angular router links and then how can you retrieve them.

Bring in the activated route as we are trying to take a snapshot of what the query parameters look like and also what the fragment in the URL looks like. Query params return an object, while fragments return a string.

Remember you have to bring in the activated route to use the snapshot option:

Now we created a details object and have variables for parts of the query params and the fragment, and we tied the variables to the snapshots of the data we already got.
