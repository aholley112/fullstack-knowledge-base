# Simulating async tasks

Create a new data service in the shared folder. This will have an asyncronous function we want to test. It needs a get details method.

Pass resolve and reject as the arguments to our call back constructor.

In a real application you don't always want to reach out to the server every time you test it. You just want to provide some dummy data.

How can we test such an asynchronous task when the stage changes during the runtime? We will write a seperate test for this and change fetch data to successfully and we will use async function that we have imported. Then wrap our call back with the function.
