# Why unit testing

Why would we want to create unit tests?
Unit tests help us guard against breaking changes.
We can analyze code behavior (expected and unexpected).
We can reveal design mistakes

UserCoponent [user]="selectedUser". We can ask the question does the component work as intended. We can also ask does the input work as intended.

UserDetailComponent @Input() user;

ReversePipe
UserService

Hopefully we get a true in our response.
