# Testing dependencies: Components and Services

So far we've had simple tests. Now we're going to add a service to our user folder.

User.service.ts 

Export class UserService {
    user: = {
        name: 'Max'
    };
}

In user component.ts. 

ngOnInit() {
    this.user = this.userService.user;
}

provide in the @Component.

We want to get the username from the service so we have to create a new test for that. We're doing this test on ngInit but we're missing one thing which happens automatically in the app running in the browser but not here.

We need to run change detection to update our properties.
