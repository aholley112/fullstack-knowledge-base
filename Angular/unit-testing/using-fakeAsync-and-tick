# Using fake async and tick

We have an alternative. It's only theoretically aynchronous. We can copy the test and call fakeAsync as well.

This must be imported from angular. Then we can get rid of the whenStable function and then we call tick() in between.

Tick also has to be imported. It means in a fake asyncronous environment, finish all asyncronous tasks now.
