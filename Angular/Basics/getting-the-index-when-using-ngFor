# Getting the index when using ngFor

The way to access the index with NgFor is through what's called a local variable. 

Each iteration inside the NgFor “loop” exposes to us a set of local variables - index , count , first , last , even , odd . 

You can see all other variables exposed to us in the NgForOf documentation.
