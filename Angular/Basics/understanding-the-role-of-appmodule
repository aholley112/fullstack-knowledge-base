# What is app Module

Angular uses components to build web pages and uses modules to basically bundle different pieces.

It bundles components into packages.

Imports allows us to add anothe rmodules to this module. You can split it up and import it into another one.

Module is just a TS class with an NGModule decorator. 

Components must be registered because Angular won't scan all files by itself. It has to be registered so Angular knows it exists.

Always import to the top and add to declarations.
