# ngClass

The ngClass directive enables you to data bind an expression that represents all of the additional classes to be added to add CSS classes to an HTML element dynamically.

The value can be a string, object, or an array.

If it is a string, it should contain one or more, space-seperated class names.

We use property binding on this directive.
