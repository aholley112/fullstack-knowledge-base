# Angular

a framework that allows you to create reactive Single Page Applications (SPAs)

You can navigate around the application but the page never changes. Every change is rendered in the browser.

# How

JS changes the DOM, changes whatever is displayed here (in the broswer) by changing the HTML code during runtime.
