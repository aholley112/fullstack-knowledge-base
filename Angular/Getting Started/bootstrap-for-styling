# Bootstrp

npm install --save bootstrap@3 in terminal. This will install locally. It will download it and store it in the noes module folder.

You must make angular aware. In the angular.json file you will change the styles section. Change to "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css", right above the "src/styles.css"

Rerun ng serve.
