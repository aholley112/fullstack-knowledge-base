# Editing

You need an IDE or editor. Webstorm is great but it's not free. Visual Studio Code is great. 

# Question

What's the benefit of a paid IDE?

# In VSC

 Upload the project into VSC.

 Go to src file and then you have your app folder. app.component.html looks very similar to the browser. Make sure you keep it running because it will watch your files.
