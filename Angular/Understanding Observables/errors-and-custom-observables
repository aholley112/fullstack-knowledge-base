# Errors and custom observables.

In most cases you will past the first argument where you're interested in the data you're getting.

We can fake an error by throwing it and defining our own condition.

# Example

if (count > 3) {
    observer.error( new Error (message: 'Count is greater 3!))
}

When an observable completes, it really is done, there are no other values emitted thereafter, which kind of makes sense because it completed.
