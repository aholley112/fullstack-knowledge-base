# Understanding operators

There's one thing you absolutely have to know about observables and the RxJS library. Operators.

Operators are the magic feature of hte RxJS library and they are the thing that really turn observable into awesome constructs.

Sometimes you don't need the raw data, you might want to transform it or filter out certain parts.

You can do this inside of your subscription or in the funtion you pass to your subscription.

But there is a better way. You can use built in operators in between.

The data points first reachc these operators that do something to the data and there are tons of built in operators.
