# Custom property and event binding summary

This component communication is such a key feature. @Input and the ability to make your properties bindable outside from the parent component using this component, these are so important.

We will use it in the recipe book in the next section because it allows you to make it very dynamic, use many components, and have them talk to eachother.

Chains of input and output can definitly grow too complex. The distance between two components is so great that building a chain of inputs and outputs it's not very practical.
