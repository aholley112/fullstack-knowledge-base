# Understanding view encapsulation

CSS styles have the goal of encapsulating the component they belong to.

It gives the same atrribute to all elements in a component.

It kind of emulates the shadow DOM, the shadow DOM is a technology not supported by all browsers where each element has it's own shadow dom behind it where you then can assign styles to each element.

Angular emulates it with view encapsulation.
