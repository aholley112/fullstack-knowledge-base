ngOnChanges will run first.

# ngOnChanges()
Respond when Angular sets or resets data-bound input properties. The method receives a SimpleChanges object of current and previous property values.
Called before ngOnInit() (if the component has bound inputs) and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.

# ngOnInit()

Initialize the directive or component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive or component's input properties. See details in Initializing a component or directive in this document.
Called once, after the first ngOnChanges(). ngOnInit() is still called even when ngOnChanges() is not (which is the case when there are no template-bound inputs).

# ngDoCheck()

Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own. See details and example in Defining custom change detection in this document.
Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.

Study reference and primative types.

# Examples

ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterContentChecked called!')
}
