# Getting access to ng content with @Contentchild

As mentioned a few lectures ago, in Angular 8+, the @ViewChild() and @ContentChild() syntaxes need to be changed slightly:

Instead of:

@ContentChild('contentParagraph') paragraph: ElementRef;
use

@ContentChild('contentParagraph', {static: true}) paragraph: ElementRef;
If you DON'T access the selected element in ngOnInit (but anywhere else in your component), set static: false instead!
For projects using Angular 9 or higher (check the package.json file to find out), you can omit static: false, you only need to specify static: true if you plan on using the selected element inside of ngOnInit().

If we want to place a local reference in our paragraph but want to use it in our server component, we can use @viewChild. It's not part of the view, it's part of the content.
