# Understanding the component lifecycle

 ngOnInit() is a life cycle hook.

 # ngOnChanges

 Called after a bound input property changes.

 # ngOnInit 

 Called once the component is initialized. This will run after the constructor.

 # ngDoCheck

 Called during every change detection run. 

 # ngAfterContentInit

 Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view.

 # ngAfterContentChecked

 Called every time the projected view (and child views) has been initialized.

 # ngAfterViewInit

 Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized.

 # ngAfterViewChecked

 Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked.

 # ngOnDestroy

 Called once the component is about to be destroyed.
 
 # lifecycle
 
 if a new component is created in Angular and of course, Angular is responsible for creating these components when it finds one of our selectors. It will instantiate a new version of that component and add it to the DOM.

 Once it is instantiated it goes through phases and it will give us a chance to hook into these phases.
