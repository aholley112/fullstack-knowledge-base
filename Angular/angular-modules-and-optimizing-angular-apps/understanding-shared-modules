# Understanding shared modules.

Now we dive into shared modules.

Products Module includes modal component, Dropdown Directive, FormsModule, ProductsComponent.

SalesModule includes all the same except instead of ProductsComponent you have SalesComponent. 

We use the shared folder and create a shared.module.ts file.

Imports you can do twice but declarations you can't.

You declare it once.
