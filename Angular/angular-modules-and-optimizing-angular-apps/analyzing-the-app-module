# Analyzing the app module

Look at what has the @NgModule decorator.

It's in app routing as well as the app component in the app.module.ts.

The declarations are necessary because everything in our declarations are there so that we can use them elsewhere in our application.

The imports array is important because it splits the app into multiple modules.

Providers array defines the services we want to provide.
