# Analyzing the app module

Look at what has the @NgModule decorator.

It's in app routing as well as the app component in the app.module.ts.

The declerations are necessary because everything in our declerations are there so that we can use them elsewhere in our application.

The imports array is important because it splits the app into multiple modules.

Providers array defines the services we want to provide.
