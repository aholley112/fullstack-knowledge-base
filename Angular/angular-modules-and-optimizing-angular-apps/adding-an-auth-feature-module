# Adding an auth feature module

We have some imports we might not need in the App Component anymore. We can drop the reactive forms module, the auth component, and the forms module.

We will create another file called auth.module.ts file and export AuthModule which receives our normal NgModule decorator.

Then pass everything we need to it.
