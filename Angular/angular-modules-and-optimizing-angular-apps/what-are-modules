# What are modules

ngModule.

Modules are ways of bundling angular building blocks together: appComponent, productsComponent, HighlightDirective, ProductsService.


AppModule: Angular analyzes NgModules to understand your application and it's features.

AppComponent: angular modules define all building blocks your app uses: Components, Directives, Services.

ProductsComponent: An app requires at least one module (AppModule) but may be split into multiple modules.

HighlightDirective: Core Angular features are included in Angular modules (e.g. FormsModule) to load them only when needed.

ProductsService: You can't use a feature/building block without including it in a module.
