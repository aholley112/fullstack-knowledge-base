# Preloading lazy loaded code

Right now we load code whenever we need it. Right now we have a tiny delay in our application. But the bigger the module and the slower the internet connection, the longer the delay will be.

We can tell angular to preload lazy loaded modules.

We go to app routing module and pass a second argument. A preloading strategy.
