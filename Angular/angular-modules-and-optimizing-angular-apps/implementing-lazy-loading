# Implementing lazy loading

If you go to network tab and reload the app on the auth page, you will see it downloads a bunch of files.

We currently have really big files in that network section. 

We add lazy loading to help this. Start with the recipes module.

For lazy loading to work your features module needs to bring its own routes.
