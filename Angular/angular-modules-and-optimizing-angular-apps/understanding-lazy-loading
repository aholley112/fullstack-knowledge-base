# Understanding lazy loading

Using multiple feature modules is a prerequesite for lazy loading.

Consider we have 3 routes, a route, products, and admin and a user that's visiting that page.

Every route is associated with a module. 

For large applications with lots of routes, consider lazy loading â€”a design pattern that loads NgModules as needed. Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times.
