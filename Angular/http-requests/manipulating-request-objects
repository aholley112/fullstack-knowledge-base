# Manipulating request objects

Inside of an interceptor, you can not only log data, but you can also modify the request object.

However, the request object itself is immutable, so you can't set request URL to a new URL, that will give you an error.

Instead if you want to modify the request, you have to create a new one.

# Example

const modifiedRequest = req.clone({headers: req.headers.append('Auth', 'xyz')})
