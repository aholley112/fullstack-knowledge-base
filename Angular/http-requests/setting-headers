# Setting headers

Now we dive into more advanced parts of Angular http requests.

When sending an Http request you set things like the URL, you send the request to and or in this case the post request. 

Sometimes you need to set special headers like when you have a back end that requires authorization and looks for an authorization header or if you want to set your own content type. Also if you need to attach a custom header because your API you are sending the request to needs it.

Any HTTP request method has an extra last argument. 

HTTP headers object has to be imported from @angular/common/http.

# Example

fetchPosts() {
    return this.http
    .get<{ [key: string]: Post }>(
        'url'
{
        headers: newHttpHeaders({ 'Custom-Header': 'Hello' })
}
