# Handling Errors

# Handling errors

So far our requests have succeeded but sometimes things can go wrong like you might not have internet access or your server fails. Dozens of issues can go wrong.

In firebase we can change the 'rules'. 

Proper error handling matters.

You can pass more arguments to subscribe in onFetchPosts in the app.component.ts.

onFetchPosts() {
// sending Http request
this.isFetching = true;
this.postsService.fetchPosts().subscribe(posts => {
    this.isFetching = false;
    this.loadedPosts = posts;
});
}

In the app.component.ts we can add

export class AppComponent implements OnInit{
    loadedPosts: Post[] = [];
    isFetching = false;
    error = null;
}

and in the HTML we can add an alert.
