# Using subjects for error handling

We could return the observable and subscribe to the component and that would be okay but there might be a better way.

# How

We can use a subject. 

We can have the error property which is a new subject and 'subject' needs to be imported from rxjs/operators. The idea is that then we can subscribe, where we get that error, we now use the subject

So this error, we call next and we pass an error message and then the remaining step is that we subscribe to that subject in all the places we're interested in.

We would subscribe in ngOnInit for example, like this and whenever we get our error message here, we could set this error equal to the error message. 

We can use a subject based strategy for forwarding the error and that is fine too.
