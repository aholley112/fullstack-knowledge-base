# Sending a delete request

We also want to clear our posts and delete data.

When the onClear post method runs we want it to send a request that deletes all posts on the backend.

We need to create deletePosts() {
   return this.http.delete('the url that targets the overal posts)
}

Now in the app compoent we want to do this.

onClearPosts() {
    //send http request
    this.postsService.deletePosts().subscribe(() => {
        this.loadedPosts = []
    })
}
