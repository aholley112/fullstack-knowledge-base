# GETting Data

We need a request that gets us all the posts.

Private property named:

private fetchPosts() {
    this.http.get(link from firebase).
    .subscribe(posts => {
        
    })
}
    Get requests don't need a second argument because you're requesting data and not sending any data.


You have to subscribe to it.
