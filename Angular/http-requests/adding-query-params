# Adding query params

For many API endpoints you can also attach certain query paramaters and of course, it depends on the API endpoint you're sending the request to, which query paramaters are supported.

# Example

The firebase REST API supports one query paramater which effect we can immediately see. You set paramaters by adding the params key herre in that same config object where you added headers and you set params equal to new.

Just as HTTP headers, you import HttpParams from @angular/common/http.

# Multiple Params

You can add multiple params by adding a search params constant

fetchPosts() {
    let searchParams = new HttpParams();
    searchParams = searchParams.append('pring', 'pretty');
    searchParams = searchParams.append('custom', 'key');
    return this.http
    etc
    url
    headers: new HttpHeaders({ 'Custom-Header })
}
