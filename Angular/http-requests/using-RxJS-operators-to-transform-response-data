# Using RxJS operators to transform response data.

Transforming data is something we could do here inside of subscribe and that would generally be okay.

But it's good practice to use observable operators because it simply allows us to write cleaner code with different steps. 


We  need to import map from rxjs/operators

This allows us to get data and return data which is then automatically re-wrapped into an observable so we can still subscribe to it.
