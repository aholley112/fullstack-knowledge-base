# Backend (firebase) setup

We need a backend.

We won't wwrite our own server solution. 

Firebase is a whole backend solution.

You will need a google account for this.

Go to add project in Firebase. Give the project any name you want. This will create a new project for you. 

It is a complete backend solution but it is not just a database.
