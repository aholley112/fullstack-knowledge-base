# Multiple Interceptors

Let's add a second intercepptor because we're not limited to one.

In this example we will use logging-interceptor.ts.

export class LoggingInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
    intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler)
}

The order of the listed interceptors matters because it's the order they will be executed.
