# Error handling and UX

If you properly handle errors it will improve the user experience.

In our alert we can create a button so the user can get rid of an error message.

<buttonclass = "btn btn-danger" (click) ="onHandleError()">Okay</button>

then in the app component we create onHandleError and set it back to null.

We also need to reset the inspection property when we get an error.
