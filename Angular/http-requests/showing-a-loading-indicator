# Showing a loading indicator

After we output the loaded post we want to work on showing a loading indicator.

We need an indicator to tell us if a request is on it's way while we're waiting on a response.

Add a new property called isLoading which initially is false and you want to set isFetching and set it to true.

this.isfetching = true.

Then in subscribe function set it back to false.

We can show a loading indicator while we're fetching posts.
