# Sending a post request

Let's start with creating a new post.

in the appcomponent.ts file we have the onCreatePost(postData: { title: string; content: string }) {
    send Http request
    this.http.post('url from firebase')
}

We need to go to the app module and add a new core Angular module. We will use HttpClientModule from 'angular/common/http';

You also add it to your imports array. This unlocks it for your whole project.

inject it into your constructor

constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

You never communicate direcly with a database from your angular app.

add .json after your firebase API.

You normally send JSON data when interacting with a RESTful API and actually, that will happen here but the Angular HttpClient will take our Javascript object here and automatically convert it to JSON.
