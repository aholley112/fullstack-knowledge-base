# Using a service for Http Requests

In bigger apps we already have a large component that is only indirectly related to the user interface.

It's a nice practice to outsource the data into services

Services do the heavy lifting and the components need to be relativly lean and need to be mostly concerned with template related work.

Create a post.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class PostsService {

    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

createAndStorePost(title: string, content: string) {
    Http request from component.

    .subscribe(responseData)
}
}
