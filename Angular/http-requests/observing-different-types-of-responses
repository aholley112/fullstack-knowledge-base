# Observing different types of responses

You can change the way the Angular HttpClient parses that response and you can basically tell Angular, "hey, please don't give me the unpacked, the extracted response data."

We have to change the observe key. Observe takes a couple of values and intellisense here incorrectly shows that I can only set a body, that actually is the default and body means that you get the response data extracted and converted to a JS object automatically. But you don't have to stick to body. You can change this to respose.

deletePosts() {
    return this.http
    .delete(url)
    observe: events
}
