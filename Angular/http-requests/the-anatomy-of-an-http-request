# The anatomy of an Http request

It is made up of a few core parts.

The most important part is the URL (API Endpoint) something like yourdomain.com/1. 

Http Verb - When communicating with a RESTful API you have to use a certain word. Something like post, get, put. Do you want to store new data, fetch new data, etc... The http word makes that clear

You need additional metadata or headers. 

You can also add body to your request.
