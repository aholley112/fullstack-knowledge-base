#Creating a recipe model.

A model should just be a blueprint for the objects that we create.

A typescript class does this job.

We can create new objects from the setup we define in this class. export class Recipe.

# Example of blueprint

export class Recipe {
  public name: string;
  public description: string;
  public imagePath: string;

  constructor(name: string, desc: string, imagePath: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.description = desc;
    this.imagePath = imagePath;
  }
}
