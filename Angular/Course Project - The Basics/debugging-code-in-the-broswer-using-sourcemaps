# Debugging code in the broswer using source maps

Sometimes you don't even get an error message or sometimes the error is not enough to tell you what to do.

# Example
In this example I can add the server many times but can't delete the last one.

# Source maps

In Chrome you can go to sources and you will find all the sources imported on the page. Try to find your code within there. If you try to place a break point there you will see something changed.
