# Creating an ingredient model

Having a model makes sense because we are using ingredients a lot.

We will store ingredient model in a new shared folder in the app folder. Shared will contain features or elements which are shared across different features.

Add an accessor in front of the property name. Example: 

export class Ingredient {

  constructor(public name: string, public amount: number) {
  }
}
