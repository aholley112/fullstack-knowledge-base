# Outputting a list of recipes with ngFor

This is the directive which allows us to repeat code with our template. 

We want to loop through all the recipes. Create a local variable named Recipe or whatever you want. This will store the recipe of each iteration in our loop. Then we will loop through all.

You can use property binding and string interpolation for this. However, in the video he decided to go with property binding. 

Example: [src]="recipe.imagePath"
