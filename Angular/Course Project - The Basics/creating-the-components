# Creating the components

Create a header folder in the app folder. Within that folder create a header.component.ts file and html file.

A component is simply just a typescript class.

You have to register all of the features and selectors you're going to use in the app module.

# --Spec False

add --spec false at the end of ng g c (file name) to prevent the creation of a testing file which we don't need.
