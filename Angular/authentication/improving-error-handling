# Improving error handling

We can dig in further in developer tools to explore the nested errors. 

In the firebase reference docs there are common errors.

We could do all the handling in the component but that is not the best way. 

It moves too much logic into the component, which should primarily focus on updating the UI and not so much aboout handling the response corrrectly.

This is why we want to use rxJS operator.
