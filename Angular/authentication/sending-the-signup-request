# Sending the sign up request

Now we have to fire up the sign in method and we do that by going to auth.component.ts.

We need to extract the value instead of logging it.

If the user disables this which is possible, the incorrect data will get sent to the back end and it will fail.

We now have to inject the auth service into the auth component.
