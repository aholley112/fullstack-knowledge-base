# Wrap Up

We have added an auth service to manage the entire front end authentication logic.

We can switch between sign up and sign in, error message handling, storing tokens, etc.

The token can fetch data and save data from our firebase backend.

There's more to managing the token. We want to store it somewhere that survivies browser reloads.

Auth guards protect routes from unauthenticated access.  

We also made sure header is updated correctly based off our authentication service.
