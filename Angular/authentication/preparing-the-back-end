# Preparing the backend

We need to be back in firebase. We don't need firebase to add authentication.

You can add it with any back-end, be that a REST or a GraphQL API.

It just needs to offer endpoints you can use to create new users and to log users in to get such a token.

Change read and write to "auth != null"
