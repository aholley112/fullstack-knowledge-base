# Adding auto login

We want to keep the token once we reload the page.

We're storing the token in the user model in the memory right now and we lose that when the application restarts because it clears automatically.

So we want to store the token somewhere else instead like a persistence storage that survives restarts.

We need to go to the handle authentication method.
