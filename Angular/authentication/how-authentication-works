 # How authentication works

 We have to understand how it works first.

 We have a client, the user using the browser, and the server. When email and password is entered it's sent to a server. We can't validate the authentication status in the browser. It has to happen on a server where the users can't do anything. 

 Otherwise information could get changed or messed up.

 Our backend, our server, will be an API.

 In authentication, the user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client. Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.
