 # How authentication works

 We have to understand how it works first.

 We have a client, the user using the browser, and the server. When email and password is entered it's sent to a server. We can't validate the authentication status in the browser. It has to happen on a server where the users can't do anything. 

 Otherwise information could get changed or messed up.

 Our backend, our server, will be an API.

 The server sends back a token.
